### 1.2.6.1 Topic Overview

Induction and construction are two fundamental methods in type theory and formal proof.

### 1.2.6.2 Principles of Induction

- Mathematical induction, structural induction
- Inductive definitions and inductive proofs

### 1.2.6.3 Constructive Proofs

- Proof as construction of objects
- Constructive proofs under dependent types

### 1.2.6.4 Formal Definition and Lean Proof

```lean
-- Example: induction on natural numbers
theorem add_zero (n : Nat) : n + 0 = n :=
begin
  induction n,
  case zero { refl },
  case succ k ih { simp [ih] }
end
```

### 1.2.6.5 Typical Cases and Reasoning

#### Induction proof (LaTeX)

\[
P(0) \land (\forall n, P(n) \implies P(n+1)) \implies \forall n, P(n)
\]
