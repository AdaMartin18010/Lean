## 4.2.1 IoT Architecture and Edge Computing

A minimal reference architecture links constrained devices, edge nodes, and cloud backends:

- Devices: sensors/actuators; communicate via MQTT/CoAP; intermittent connectivity.
- Edge: performs filtering, aggregation, model inference; enforces local safety policies.
- Cloud: long-term storage, fleet management, retraining, global coordination.

Consistency choices: eventual consistency for telemetry; exactly-once semantics via idempotent sinks. Security uses mTLS and hardware roots of trust on devices.

## 4.2.2 Code Example

```rust
// Rust pseudo-code: IoT device
struct IoTDevice {
    id: String,
    sensors: Vec<Sensor>,
    edge_compute: EdgeNode,
}
```
