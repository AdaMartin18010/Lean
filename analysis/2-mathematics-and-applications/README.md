## Overview

This section systematically introduces the mathematical foundations and their applications, including a panoramic analysis of mathematical content, the relationship between mathematics and formal languages, and other advanced topics. All content is strictly structured, cross-referenced, and includes multi-representations (LaTeX, Lean/Haskell/Rust code, diagrams).
